Hello! I'm Peter, an engineer, researcher, and coder passionate about solving complex problems. I leverage design thinking and thorough research methodologies while embracing the challenges of continuous learning. My GitHub showcases my journey, featuring projects in coding challenges, engineering innovations, and machine learning.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 Postgraduate Researcher in Engineering Design, exploring innovative solutions and methodologies.
- 💡 Developer of CAD refactoring techniques and a pioneer in characterising CAD smells, aiming to enhance design efficiency and maintainability.
- 💻 Recently started woking on LeetCode problems. See [all of my solutions](https://github.com/rossop/LeetCode).
- 🛠️ Advocate for clean code and software architecture. I am a self-taught programmer who is always striving to improve my practices.
- 📖 Enthusiast of non-fiction and fantasy literature with a keen interest in the intersections of storytelling, creativity, and technology.
- 💻 Participant in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), where I challenge my coding skills and share solutions. See [some of my solutions](https://github.com/rossop/AdventOfCode).

## 🌟 Highlighted Projects

- **CAD Refactoring and Smells**: I've explored and documented CAD refactoring techniques I've developed, including a comprehensive analysis of CAD smells aimed at improving engineering design processes.
- **[Advent of Code Solutions](https://github.com/rossop/AdventOfCode/)**: This is my journey through the Advent of Code, which demonstrates my problem-solving approach and coding versatility.
- **[protoRAG](https://github.com/rossop/proto-rag/)**: A simple example of a prototype Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system developed using Python, GPT, and LangChain to retrieve information from technical PDFs. The system enhances data accessibility by implementing text extraction, chunking, and vector-based retrieval, integrated with a Neo4j knowledge graph to improve retrieval accuracy and context.
- **[Data Scraper](https://github.com/rossop/data-scraper/)**: This project includes two main functionalities:
    - **PDF Scraper**: Automates the extraction of PDF files from specified URLs, organising them systematically in the user's Downloads directory. This tool is essential for collecting and managing research papers and other academic resources efficiently.
    - **Goodreads Scraper**: Extracts comprehensive book data from Goodreads, including ratings and anonimised reviews. Utilises Selenium to navigate through the website, ensuring thorough data collection even when reviews are paginated or hidden behind additional interactions. This tool will aid in performing detailed sentiment analysis and behavioural research on book reviews as they are scraped.
> - **Goodreads Analysis Project**: Project is temporaly closed to make sure that data analysis complies with Goodreads _Terms and Conditions_.
