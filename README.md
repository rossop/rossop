# Welcome to Peter Rosso's GitHub 👋

Hello! I'm Peter, an engineer, researcher, and coder passionate about solving complex problems. I leverage design thinking and thorough research methodologies while embracing the challenges of continuous learning. My GitHub showcases my journey, featuring projects in coding challenges, engineering innovations, and machine learning.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 Postgraduate Researcher in Engineering Design, exploring innovative solutions and methodologies.
- 💡 Developer of CAD refactoring techniques and a pioneer in characterising CAD smells, aiming to enhance design efficiency and maintainability.
- 💻 Participant in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), where I challenge my coding skills and share solutions. See [some of my solutions](https://github.com/rossop/AdventOfCode).
- 🛠️ Advocate for clean code and software architecture. I am a self-taught programmer who is always striving to improve my practices.
- 📖 Enthusiast of non-fiction and fantasy literature with a keen interest in the intersections of storytelling, creativity, and technology.

## 🌟 Highlighted Projects

- **CAD Refactoring and Smells**: I've explored and documented CAD refactoring techniques I've developed, including a comprehensive analysis of CAD smells aimed at improving engineering design processes.
- **[Advent of Code Solutions](https://github.com/rossop/AdventOfCode/)**: This is my journey through the Advent of Code, which demonstrates my problem-solving approach and coding versatility.
- **[protoRAG](https://github.com/rossop/protoRAG/)**: A simple example of a prototype Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system developed using Python, GPT, and LangChain to retrieve information from technical PDFs. The system enhances data accessibility by implementing text extraction, chunking, and vector-based retrieval, integrated with a Neo4j knowledge graph to improve retrieval accuracy and context.


## 📚 Publications

I've contributed to various publications in engineering design, focusing on practical and theoretical advancements. For a detailed look at my research and publications, check out [my Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=eM_RGJcAAAAJ).
